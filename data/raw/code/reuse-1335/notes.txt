Aside: Abstracting Tests
Inheritance vs. Composition






























Problem: I want to reuse code from a base class but I don't want to or cannot inherit from
         that base class.

Solution: Composition

1. In your new class, add a field of the type you want to reuse. This is called a delegate.

2. In your new class, whenever you want to reuse code, call the delegate.


Let A and B be classes.

Use inheritance if B IS-A A.

Use composition if B HAS-A A (or you can't inherit)



























We are keeping databases for students and employees. This means we have a Student class
and Employee class.


1. I want to make a Faculty class. Do I inherit or compose? And with what?
    - Inherit b/c Faculty IS-A Employee.

2. Say we want to make a Student page with their details. Do I inherit or compose?
    - Compose b/c Student page HAS-A student.
    - Compose b/c Student pages IS NOT A student.

3. Say I want to make a record of a class section. Do I inherit or compose?
    - Compose b/c a class HAS-A Student and HAS-A Employee (technically Faculty)



4. Students can also be employees. So we want a StudentEmployee Record. Inherit or compose?
    - While it makes sense to inherit from both, we can't. Java disallows this.

    - Inherit the one that has more code to reuse, compose with the other
    - Compose with both
