Representation of Card

- Rank(int) and Suit(enum)
- Rank(enum) and Suit(enum)
- Rank(int) and Suit(String)
- Rank(enum) and Suit(String)
- Rank(String, int) and Suit(enum) [an older design]

How do you handle the fact Aces have two values?
- Ranks can have multiple values
- Handled specially when checking straights, but one value

Should the Card keep track of its position on the board?
    - No.
    - Board already tracks the cards. Removal from the board would mean extra work.
    - Don't want to add mutability to the card itself.


Represenation of board

- Card[][] // first index is row, second is column
    - each row has exactly the right number of positions for a triangle
    - each row has length sideLength
    - List<int[]> that states the valid positions
- List<List<Card>> // first index is row, second is column
