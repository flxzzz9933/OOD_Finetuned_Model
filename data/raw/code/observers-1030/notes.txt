Problem: I have classes A and B. I wish A could react to events from B.

Solution: Observer Pattern

1. Let A be called the Observer, B called the Subject.

2. Define an interface of Actions that detail all relevant events from B.

3. To your Subject, add a method to subscribe to the Subject.

    public void subscribe(Actions observer) {...}

4. To your Subject, any time the Subject must notify the Observer a relevant event occured,
    call the related method from the Actions interface on the observer.

5. To your Observer, implement the Actions interface. The implementation of those methods
    are the reactions to the event.

6. Finally, SOMEWEHRE in your code, have the Observer subscribe to the Subject.
