Aside: Abstracting Tests
Inheritance vs. Composition


Problem: I want to reuse code but I don't want to or cannot inherit from the class.

Solution: Composition

1. In your new class, add a field of the type you want to reuse. This is called a delegate.

2. In your new class, whenever you want to reuse code, call the delegate.





We are keeping databases for students and employees. This means we have a Student class
and Employee class.


1. I want to make a Faculty class. Do I inherit or compose? And with what?
    - Inherit makes sense since Faculty IS-A employee.
2. Say we want to make a Student page with their details. Do I inherit or compose?
    - Composition makes sense since a student page IS NOT a student.
3. Say I want to make a record of a class section. Do I inherit or compose?
    - Composition makes sense since a class HAS-A student AND HAS-A faculty.
4. Students can also be employees. So we want a StudentEmployee Record. Inherit or compose?
    - inherit from Student, compose with Employee (b/c they were a student first)
    - inherit from Employee, compose with Student
    - compose with both (but lose any client-side code reuse of Student and Employee)
