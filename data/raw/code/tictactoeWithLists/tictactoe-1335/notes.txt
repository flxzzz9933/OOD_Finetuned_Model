1. HW2 notes
    - I suggest you have already gotten a preliminary design and started
      writing implementations/tests by now.
    - Only submit what the assignment asks you to (src/test folders).
      Every extra item is something the graders must click through to grade
      AND it costs you points.
    - Want more behaviors for cards for your use? Make a new interface
      and have it extend the Card interface. Anything else is bad design.
    - Never make a public helper method. Period.
    - Did you notice that your source code's method implementations must be
      50 lines or fewer?
