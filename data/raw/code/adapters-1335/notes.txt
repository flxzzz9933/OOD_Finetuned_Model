Topics
- Adapters in general
- Adapters in MVC (will carry us over to Monday, bring laptops)


Adapter: a class that converts one type (adaptee) to another (target)

1. Identify the adaptee and the target.
2. Make a new class that reuses code from the adaptee to implement target's interface.

Class adapter: an adapter that inherits from the adaptee
Object adapter: an adapter that composes with the adaptee



















Midterm topics: Everything from Exam 1 plus
- Observer pattern
- Strategies
- Decorators
- Adapters (today + Monday)
- (From Exam 1, but to emphasize) interface and class design

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: Practice Exam?
A: Of course! Practice Exam open up next Tuesday on Canvas.

Q: Cheat sheet?
A: 8.5 inch by 11 inch paper, double-sided. (Regular printer paper)

Q: Scratch paper?
A: I'll provide scratch paper for you.

Q: General practice?
A: This exam is heavier on the design. Like what you did for HW5.
   So consider taking previous specifications and designing classes for them.
   For example, HW2 does give the specification for PokerTriangles. Design
   your OWN interface. What choices did you make and can you back them up
   using the specification itself?

Q: Review session?
A: Yes. Next Thursday, Monday, and Wednesday.
