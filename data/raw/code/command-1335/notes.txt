1. I have OH tomorrow, 1-3pm. Meserve 335.
2. Your lab on Monday is on Builders, today's topic.































Problem: I wish I could separate the I/O part of my controller
         from the part that knows how to execute commands.

Solution: Command Design Pattern

1. Create an interface for all of our commands and it has one method:
    void execute(... whatever is needed to execute any command...)

2. For each command we wish to execute, create a class
   that implements the command interface. If the command
   needs extra information, pass it into the constructor.

3. In the controller, when a command is recognized, create the
    corresponding command object. Execute it at the end of the
    switch statement.





Problem: I wish I had a way to allow the client to customize an object.

Solution: Make a Builder for the object.

1. Say Foo is the object you want to customize. Create a new class called
   FooBuilder.

2. Add fields to FooBuilder corresponding to the customization options.

3. For every customization you want to allow a client to do, create
   the following method:

   public FooBuilder <insert-meaningful-name-of-option> (... args needed for customization...) {
        //... customize as needed
        return this;
   }

4. If there are default values for your customizations, add a constructor to initialize them.

   public FooBuilder() {
    //... init fields to defaults if possible
   }

5. Add the build() method to construct the object.

   public Foo build() {
        return new Foo(... args derived from fields ...);
   }
