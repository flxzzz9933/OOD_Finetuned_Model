Announcements

1. HW4 out today, due next Wednesday.
    - Building variants of the model
    - Last assignment with JUnit tests!
2. Second project begins next week. Register a team of 2 on Handins!
    - How late days work with group assignments.

Topics
- Practicing the mechanics of inheritance (and composition?)
- Design Review of PokerTriangles representation









Your Card representation

- Rank and Suit (enums)
- Rank and Suit (Strings) -- checked for correctness in constructor
- Rank (int) and Suit (enum) -- 14 is an Ace

Rank enum : How would you handle Aces?
    - Only one value to make creating the deck correct
    - Two values for Ace, but one value was only used for scoring
    - Every value has String representation , high, and low integer values
    - Only one value and just check specially in scoring for straight



Representing the board

Card[][] //first index is row, second is column
    - each row had a different length
    - each row had same length, but calculated valid positions
List<List<Card>> // first index is row, second is column
    - get method usage is a little messy and inconvenient
    - set vs. add usage
Map<Posn, Card>
    - deal with out of bounds positions
    - too abstract because it can be ANY shape
A separate object (Card[][])
    - add extra board behaviors or RESTRICT usage
    - decomplexify the model
