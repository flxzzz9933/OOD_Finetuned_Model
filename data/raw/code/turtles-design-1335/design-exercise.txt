Turtle graphics uses an alternative system of measuring and
drawing instead of the conventional Cartesian coordinate system.

Turtle graphics is based on the notion of a turtle moving
on screen. At any given time, the turtle has a position
and a direction in which it is pointing. The turtle can walk
only in the direction that it is pointing (i.e. along a
straight line). It can change its direction by turning
in its place. It is also able to save its current state and
able to return to it.































The controller for this turtle program must perform the following commands

- "q" or "Q" for quitting the program.
- "move <distance>" where distance is a double and moves the turtle
    in a straight line the given distance without drawing
- "turn <angle> where angle is a double and turns the turtle counter-clockwise
    the given amount of degrees
- "trace <distance>" where distance is an integer and moves the turtle
    in a straight line the given distance WHILE drawling
- "showLines" which prints the lines drawn to System.out
- "save" which saves the turtle's current state
- "retrieve" which retrieves the turtle's saved state, returning it to that state
- If you get none of these commands, print an error message to System.out

NOTE: Assume every command with arguments will always give you the correct
      type of data. (angle/distance are double/int respectively always)
