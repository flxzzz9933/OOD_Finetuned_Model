    - You have multiple view and observer examples on Canvas
      modules, lab, and on course website.

Topics
- Strategies
















Strategies are function objects that at runtime decide how to
implement a feature (e.g. how to DO something)?

interface Strategy {
    ... // the one function you want to implement
}










Decorators are classes that
    - have the same type as what they decorate
    - have as a field the object they decorate
    - apply some change in behavior to some existing object

e.g.

class Decorator implements IBase {
    IBase base;

    public Decorator(IBase base) {
        ....
    }
} // preferred because not dependent on implementation

OR

class Decorator extends Base {
    Base base; //or a more general type if applicable

    public Decorator(Base base) {
        ...
    }
} // might be necessary, but dependent on the implementation












interface Beverage {
    Size size();
    double price();
}

enum Size { SMALL, MED, LARGE };

class Coffee implements Beverage { ... }
class Tea implements Beverage { ... }

Add-ons:
- Milk
- Cream
- Sugar
- Fruit
- Syrups
- Whipped Cream
- Charcoal

class MilkAdded implements Beverage {

    private Beverage base;

    public MilkAdded(Beverage base) {
        this.base = base;
    }

    public Size size() {
        return this.base.size():
    }

    public double price() {
        return 1.00 + this.base.price();
    }
}

class CharcoalAdded implements Beverage {

    private Beverage base;

    public CharcoalAdded(Beverage base) {
        this.base = base;
    }

    public Size size() {
        return this.base.size():
    }

    public double price() {
        switch(this.base.size()) {
            case SMALL : return this.base.price() + 15;
            case MED: return this.base.price() + 20;
            case LARGE: return this.base.price() + 3500;
        }
    }
}


// a tea with milk, sugar, honey
new HoneyAdded(new SugarAdded(new MilkAdded(new Tea())));
new SugarAdded(new MilkAdded(new HoneyAdded(new Tea())));

// a coffee with milk
new MilkAdded(new Coffee());

MilkAdded, HoneyAdded, SugarAdded etc. are DECORATORS

Decorators are classes that are and contain what they decorate to add or change existing behavior of
that object.

(Aside: It is common to have a builder to build a decorated object
    because decorating an object implies adding customizability)
