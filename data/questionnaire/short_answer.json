      "topic": "adapter",
      "question": "Explain why an object adapter is necessary when adapting an existing Enumeration-implementing class to the Iterator interface, rather than using a class adapter.",
      "expected_answer": "Since the Enumeration-implementing class already exists and cannot be modified, we cannot make it extend an adapter class. An object adapter wraps instances of the existing class through composition, delegating hasNext() to hasMoreElements() and next() to nextElement(), without requiring changes to the adaptee's class hierarchy.",

      "topic": "adapter",
      "question": "In a two-way adapter implementing both IntSet1 and IntSet2 interfaces, explain how the add(int value) method from IntSet1 can be implemented using only IntSet2 operations.",
      "expected_answer": "The add(int value) method can be implemented by calling adaptee.unionWith(IntSet2Impl.singleton(value)). This creates a singleton set containing just the value to add, then unions it with the existing set. The unionWith operation adds all elements from the parameter set to this set.",

      "topic": "adapter",
      "question": "What is the appropriate way to implement the remove() method when adapting Enumeration to Iterator, and why?",
      "expected_answer": "Throw UnsupportedOperationException because Enumeration has no concept of removal - it only supports hasMoreElements() and nextElement(). The Iterator interface documentation specifies that remove() may throw this exception when the underlying structure doesn't support removal. The default implementation in Iterator already throws this exception.",
      "key_concepts": ["UnsupportedOperationException", "Enumeration lacks removal", "documented failure mode", "default method"]

      "topic": "mvc",
      "question": "Explain why a TicTacToeConsoleController constructor should accept Readable and Appendable parameters rather than directly using System.in and System.out.",
      "expected_answer": "Accepting Readable and Appendable enables dependency injection, allowing the controller to be tested without actual console I/O. Tests can pass StringReader with predetermined input and StringBuilder to capture output, enabling automated verification of controller behavior. This decouples the controller from specific I/O implementations.",

      "topic": "mvc",
      "question": "In MVC, what is the responsibility of each component (Model, View, Controller) in handling a user clicking a cell in a graphical TicTacToe game?",
      "expected_answer": "Controller: Receives the click event from the View, translates pixel coordinates to board position (row, col), validates the move is legal, and calls the Model's move method. Model: Updates game state (board, current player, win condition), notifies observers of state change. View: Observes Model changes and repaints the board to reflect the new state, without direct Controller involvement in display updates.",

      "id": "sa_006",
      "topic": "mvc",
      "question": "Why should a Controller catch IOException from Appendable.append() and throw IllegalStateException instead of propagating the IOException?",
      "expected_answer": "IOException is a checked exception that would force all callers to handle I/O failures, which is inappropriate for game logic. An IOException during output represents an unrecoverable state (output stream failed), so wrapping it in IllegalStateException (unchecked) signals that the program cannot continue normally. This keeps the Controller's interface clean while properly signaling catastrophic failure.",

      "topic": "observer",
      "question": "Describe a scenario where the Observer pattern can lead to infinite recursion, and how this can be prevented.",
      "expected_answer": "If an Observer's update() method modifies the Subject it's observing, and that modification triggers notifyObservers() again, infinite recursion occurs. Prevention strategies include: using a flag to track if notification is in progress and skipping re-notification, queuing changes to be processed after current notification completes, or designing observers to not modify subjects during updates.",

      "topic": "decorator",
      "question": "Explain how Swing's JScrollPane demonstrates the Decorator pattern and why this design is beneficial.",
      "expected_answer": "JScrollPane wraps another component (like JPanel) and adds scrollbar functionality while delegating core behavior to the wrapped component. Benefits include: composition over inheritance (any JComponent can be scrolled), multiple decorators can be combined (JScrollPane around JBorderPane around JPanel), and single responsibility (each decorator adds one feature). The wrapped component doesn't need to know it's being decorated.",

      "id": "sa_009",
      "topic": "decorator",
      "question": "What distinguishes the Decorator pattern from simple inheritance, and when would you choose Decorator over subclassing?",
      "expected_answer": "Decorator uses composition: a decorator implements the same interface as the component and holds a reference to a component instance, forwarding calls while adding behavior. Unlike inheritance, decorators can be combined dynamically at runtime, can wrap any implementation of the interface, and avoid class explosion from combinatorial feature combinations. Choose Decorator when features should be composable or when you can't modify the class hierarchy.",

      "topic": "strategy",
      "question": "Design a TicTacToeStrategy interface for implementing different AI move-selection algorithms. What parameters should the strategy method receive and why?",
      "expected_answer": "Interface should have: Coord chooseMove(TicTacToeModel model, Piece forWhom). The model parameter provides access to board state (which cells are occupied, whose turn it is, if game is over). The forWhom parameter specifies which player the strategy is choosing for, necessary because the same strategy instance might be used for both players or we need to evaluate from a specific player's perspective.",

      "topic": "strategy",
      "question": "How does the Strategy pattern relate to 'function objects' in Java, and how might lambdas simplify strategy implementation?",
      "expected_answer": "Strategy pattern encapsulates an algorithm in an object - the object represents a function/behavior. In Java, a strategy interface with a single method is a functional interface, so strategies can be implemented as lambdas. Instead of creating a CornerStrategy class, you can write: (model, piece) -> findCornerMove(model). This reduces boilerplate while maintaining the pattern's flexibility.",

      "question": "In a turtle graphics application, explain how the Command pattern enables implementing an undo feature for turtle movements.",
      "expected_answer": "Each turtle action (move, turn) becomes a Command object storing the action and parameters. Before execution, the Command stores the turtle's current position/heading. Execute() performs the action, undo() restores the saved state. A command history stack maintains executed commands. Undo pops the last command and calls its undo(), which restores the turtle's previous state. Multiple undos work by continuing to pop and undo.",

      "question": "Compare the save()/restore() methods on a SimpleTurtle (using position/heading stacks) with the Command pattern. Are they the same pattern?",
      "expected_answer": "They are different patterns. save()/restore() implements a Memento-like pattern - saving complete state snapshots to a stack and restoring them. Command pattern would encapsulate each move/turn as an object with execute/undo methods. Save/restore saves checkpoints regardless of what operations occurred; Command tracks individual operations. They can complement each other but serve different purposes.",

      "question": "Explain the 'fragile base class problem' using the example of InstrumentedIntSet extending IntSet, where both have add() and addAll() methods.",
      "expected_answer": "If InstrumentedIntSet overrides add() to increment a counter, and also overrides addAll() to add elements.length to the counter then call super.addAll(), problems arise if the base IntSet.addAll() internally calls add() for each element. The counter increments in both addAll() (for the batch) and in each add() call (from super.addAll()), resulting in double-counting. The subclass is fragile because it depends on undocumented base class implementation details.",

      "topic": "inheritance",
      "question": "How can a base class be 'designed for inheritance' to prevent the fragile base class problem?",
      "expected_answer": "Document all self-use patterns (which methods call which internally). Use private helper methods for shared implementation rather than having public methods call each other. Mark methods as final if they shouldn't be overridden. Factor out common code into private methods that subclasses can't intercept. Alternatively, consider making the class final and preferring composition over inheritance.",

      "question": "Rewrite an InstrumentedIntSet using composition instead of inheritance. What are the key structural differences?",
      "expected_answer": "Declare a private final IntSet delegate field initialized in constructor. Implement IntSet interface by forwarding all methods to delegate (delegate.add(), delegate.remove(), etc.). For instrumentation, add counting logic in add() and addAll() before/after delegating. Key differences: no 'extends', explicit delegation, immune to base class self-use changes, can wrap any IntSet implementation, must implement all interface methods explicitly.",

      "question": "Explain why assertEquals(new int[] {3, 6}, new int[] {3, 6}) fails in JUnit, and how to correctly test array equality.",
      "expected_answer": "Java arrays use reference equality for equals() - two arrays with identical contents are not 'equal' unless they're the same object. assertEquals calls equals(), which compares references, so two separately created arrays fail even with same contents. Use assertArrayEquals() instead, which compares array contents element by element. For multidimensional arrays, use assertArrayEquals with proper deep comparison.",

      "question": "What is the difference between @Before and @BeforeClass annotations in JUnit, and when would you use each?",
      "expected_answer": "@Before runs before each test method - use for test fixtures that should be fresh for each test (ensuring test isolation). @BeforeClass runs once before any tests in the class - use for expensive setup shared across tests (like database connections) that doesn't affect test isolation. @BeforeClass methods must be static.

      "question": "Compare testing an expected exception using @Test(expected=...) versus assertThrows(). When is assertThrows preferred?",
      "expected_answer": "assertThrows is preferred when you need to verify exception details beyond just the type. assertThrows returns the exception object, allowing assertions on its message, cause, or other properties. @Test(expected=...) only verifies that some code in the method threw that exception type - it can't test which line threw it or what the message was. assertThrows with a lambda also precisely identifies which code should throw.",

      "question": "What is a mock object and how does it facilitate testing a Controller that depends on a Model?",
      "expected_answer": "A mock object simulates a real object with controlled, predictable behavior for testing. For testing a Controller, create a mock Model that returns predetermined values and records method calls. This lets you: test Controller logic in isolation, verify the Controller calls correct Model methods, simulate various Model states/responses without complex setup, and test error handling by having the mock throw exceptions.",

      "expected_answer": "Static factory advantages: descriptive names (empty() vs new IntSet2Impl() with no indication it's empty), can return cached instances instead of always creating new objects, can return any subtype of the declared return type (implementation hiding), can return different implementations based on parameters, not required to create a new object each call.

      "expected_answer": "MouseListener has five methods (clicked, pressed, released, entered, exited) - implementing it requires providing all five, even if empty. MouseAdapter is an abstract class with empty default implementations of all MouseListener methods. By extending MouseAdapter, you only override the methods you need (mouseClicked), avoiding clutter from unused empty implementations. This follows the Adapter pattern principles.",

Override paintComponent() for custom drawing because it's called specifically for the component's content after borders are drawn and before children. Always call super.paintComponent(g) first to ensure the panel is properly cleared/initialized - without this, previous paint artifacts may remain, especially with transparent backgrounds or when resizing.",

Readable is an interface that can be implemented by StringReader for testing - construct with predetermined input string, no console interaction needed.
